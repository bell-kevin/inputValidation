# inputValidation
Create a project that asks the user for a minimum integer, then a maximum integer, then a value between those two numbers. The program needs to validate that the second number is greater than the first number, and it also needs to validate that the third number is between the first two numbers.  Use 3 While loops, which will repeat over and over until the input value meets the criteria. Do not use any IF structures. Do not prompt for the input first, then test it in a While loop (priming the input) – instead, prompt for the data and read it from the scanner inside the loop. To do that, set the values for the 3 variables to something that is clearly invalid (like -1), so that the test in the While loop will always start out true. For example, if a variable named “minimum” is set to -1 when it is declared, then a While loop that tests if the minimum is less than 1 will be true, and the code inside the While loop will execute, which should prompt the user for the value, then read the data from the scanner.

Note that there must be a title and your name at the top of the output. The prompts must allow the user to enter input to the right of the same line as the prompt. Note that the same prompt is repeated if the input was invalid. Once a valid number is input, the next prompt asks for new data.

Be sure to include the minimum and maximum values in the prompt for the middle value.

Echo the values as shown above once valid values have been entered.

Take a screenshot of the running program that matches the sample session, and include the code above it. Run the program again and enter different values, with at least one invalid entry in each section, then take a screenshot of the results.

 

Pay careful attention to the rubric for this assignment. Even if not specifically mentioned in the assignment, you are responsible for the following:

    Use descriptive names for all variables
    Add comments describing the use or meaning of variables
    Do NOT include literal values in any calculations, always use variables
    Always include a header in the output with a descriptive title and your name
    If asking for input, make sure the user types on the same line as the question
    Where sample sessions are provided, output from your project must match it

Note that you must use correct formatting in the code -- appropriate indentation is most important. You can use Shift-Alt-F to have NetBeans automatically format the code correctly. If the formatting is incorrect, it will be returned to you for changes with a grade of zero.

Submission: the specified screenshots and the root folder for the project

Note: You need to submit the whole project for these assignments. In File Explorer, go to the location where you created the project. There will be a folder with the name of your project -- that is the root folder of the project.  If you submit the root folder of the project, the instructor can run it on a different machine to grade it. If you don't submit the proper folder, it won't run on another machine, and the assignment will be marked with a zero.
